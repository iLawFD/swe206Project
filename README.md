# Generating a table & seeing the table of matches

After adding 6 teams, we can generate a table of matches ( with the number being the day diff between matches)

# Matches
Here you can see the matches of all tournaments and search for them by date ( including the one we generated above)
Now we can just select a match. Enter its scores and accordingly the table of matches of this tournmanet will change 

( For Elmination you have to first enter half of matches's scores to be able to generate the rest of the matches (to know who will play againts whom ). For round robin there is ro ristrick
you can just enter the score of the first matche or the first two matches  the points will be calculted and if you press get winner the one with highest point will be displayed
if there is a draw you have to enter other details to determine who won ( the number of goals)
